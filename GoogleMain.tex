\begin{section}{Objectives}
 Apply my programming skills in a summer internship. 
 
 I'm especially interested in the mathematical aspects of algorithm design, for example in machine learning; to such projects I would bring a strong mathematical background of proof and problem-solving.
\end{section}

\begin{section}{Qualifications}
 \subsubsection*{Technical Coursework}
  My studies focus on CS, physics, and pure math. I've taken the following courses, earning a majority of A+'s; courses planned for academic year 2015-16 are in grey:
  \begin{description}
   \item Intro Programming (280), Machine Learning (545), {\color{gray} Artificial Intelligence (492),
         Algo.s and Data Structures (281), OO and Advanced Programming (381), Circuits and Signals (215, 216), Design Project: Automatic Newspaper-Reader (Engr 355).}

  \item Honors Mechanics and E\&M (160, 260 + labs), Statistical Mechanics (510), Modern Physics (390),
        Quantum Mechanics (511, 512), {\color{gray} Quantum Field Theory I (513).}

  \item Honors Math/Analysis (295-396), Differential Equations (316), Probability (425), Math for Finance (423),
        Coding Theory (567), Honors Algebra (493, 494), Explorations in Math (389),
        {\color{gray} Commutative Rings (614,615), Combinatorics (565, 566).}
  \end{description}
  Note: some of the above courses I took while I was in high-school, just for fun. However, I did perform all coursework and was graded on the same scale as official students. Instructor email addresses are available upon request.


 \subsubsection*{Work Experience}
  \begin{description}
  \item Math Tutor at Eastern Michigan University (2011-2014)
  \item Course Assistant for Math 389 (Winters 2015, {\color{gray}2016})
  \item REU Undergrad Researcher in Math (Summer 2015), resulting in \href{http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08337}{this paper}, written with Stella Gastineau under the mentorship of Andrew Snowden.
  \end{description}

 \subsubsection*{Programming Experience (6 Years)}
  Fluent in Python, C++. Experience in C, C\#, Java, Perl, HTML, PHP, JavaScript.
  
  I've been creating personal projects such as games, text editors, natural language processors, and image processors for several years. 
  
  Combining my passions for physics and computational efficiency, I also have experience in scientific simulations: for example, I've written optimized n-body simulators, Monte-Carlo simulations to study phase transitions, and various numerical PDE solvers. And recently, I've started exploring web development\textemdash my skills here are
  currently limited, but I'm excited to learn more.

  Selected Projects:
