I just met my hero: Douglas Hofstadter. He was visiting Ann Arbor, giving a talk

My interests sprawl. 

On my bookshelf sits a certain book

I started programming in middle school. It began as a way to entertain friends:
my first two memorable programs were a chatbot and a text-adventure game.
Around the same time, I read about the P=NP conjecture and that
the design of algorithms was nontrivial (a difficult and interesting subject).

I want to work on large-scale machine-learning and artificial intelligence projects.
Subgoals for this include advancing my programming skills as far as possible, and
learning .

The Engineering Practicum program is a great way to develop these skills: with all of Google's projects
as large-scale as they are, the program seems an especially good match for my interests.
